Numerically, the data corresponding to $x(t)$ will be given as a series of points, not continuous values. So in practice we must transform _sampled_ data stored as an array $[x_0,x_1,x_2...]$ of points, taken at equal time intervals $\\Delta t$ apart. (This is what we usually get from an experiment.)\n",

(The reason for this repetition is discussed later in PX2232, but is proved by multiplying $x(t)$ in equation (Eq. [1](#mjx-eqn-eq:1)) by a periodic series of Dirac delta functions, then Fourier transforming.)\n",
        "\n",
        "It follows, very importantly, that we must sample a signal at a fast enough rate to ensure that we cover a large enough frequency range to examine our signal. It’s not just that we would miss out on the higher frequency components that might be of interest - if higher frequencies are present in the pre-sampled signal, they actually appear in the transformed signal in the wrong place: this is known as _aliasing_. (In experiments, data is usually sampled after the signal goes through an analog _anti-aliasing filter_ to remove these higher frequencies.)\n",

This has the effect of broadening otherwise infinitely sharp peaks, unless $\\tau$ happens to match exactly the period of the underlying signal(s). (The reason for this is again discussed in PX2232. The proof is based on multiplying $x(t)$ in equation (Eq. [1](#mjx-eqn-eq:1)) by a top-hat function, and considering a ‘convolution’ in frequency space.)\n",

        "Since the data we possess must be recorded over a finite time window $\\tau$, we in fact can assume anything we like for the data outside this time interval (The Fourier transform components will still represent the known signal in the finite window exactly). The maths becomes far simpler if let the $x$ data itself repeat periodically outside this window, since this results in a Fourier _series_. In other words, only certain discrete frequencies are needed to represent the original signal if we use this assumption. The frequencies are all multiples of the $1/\\tau$, so the point separation in frequency space is $\\Delta f = 1/\\tau$. This is also illustrated, in figure 2(e).\n",

This results in a discrete Fourier transform or DFT, illustrated in figure 2(f), with $N$ points repeating with frequency $F_s$.\n",

To put the latter in the ‘correct’ position we can reorder them, so that point 15 appears effectively in the -1 position, point 14 in the -2 position, and so on (since the FT is periodic with period $F_s$, there isn’t really a ‘correct’ interval any more. The algorithm returns the interval $0$ to $F_s$, but you might prefer $-F_s/2$ to $F_s/2$. You will meet exactly this idea in describing periodic crystal structures, where the FT is actually the reciprocal lattice).\n",
